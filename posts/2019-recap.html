        <h2>2019 Recap</h2>
        <p>December 23, 2019</p>
        <p>
          This year was a very busy year for me. Here are some of the big things
          that happened throughout the year.
        </p>
        <h3>January</h3>
        <p>
          Mentally prepared for another New York winter. Became a tourist in my
          own city and went to Rockefeller Center. Sandy went to Mexico to visit
          her sick grandmother. Survived a cold and windy snow storm that blew
          Sandy over outside of our apartment.
        </p>
        <h3>February</h3>
        <p>
          Some of my family came to visit, which included my dad, Diggy,
          Valentina, Alyssa, my Aunt Heidi, and Drew. We did a bunch of touristy
          stuff with them and rode bikes across a few bridges in Queens,
          Manhattan, and Brooklyn.
        </p>
        <h3>March</h3>
        <p>
          Sandy flew to Los Angeles for a few days to look at potential
          apartments for us. Enjoyed some nice weather in New York. Rode to Red
          Hook and visited a few spots there.
        </p>
        <h3>April</h3>
        <p>
          Sandy turned 26 and we celebrated at a
          <span style="color: dodgerblue">Dodger</span> game. We moved from
          Brooklyn back to Los Angeles.
        </p>
        <h3>May</h3>
        <p>
          Settled back in to Los Angeles living. Immediately hit up our classic
          go to spots (Bernadettes, DTLA Ramen, OB Bear, Apple Pan) and finally
          went to
          <a href="https://salazarla.com">Salazar</a>. The food was great, but
          the service was terrible. Will probably go back though.
        </p>
        <h3>June</h3>
        <p>
          Spent a nice weekend with Sandy at the Ace Hotel and Swim Club in Palm
          Springs. Saw Jaws at Cinespia in Hollywood. Rode Critical Mass with my
          Dad and Sandy at the end of the month.
        </p>
        <h3>July</h3>
        <p>Visited the Orange County fair and enjoyed a mild summer.</p>
        <h3>August</h3>
        <p>
          We had to put Walter down. He was just shy of 9 years old. Rode the
          Hollywood Ciclavia (East Hollywood to West Hollywood). Sandy got a
          nice new All City Space Horse bike.
        </p>
        <h3>September</h3>
        <p>
          Turned 30 years old. Celebrated at Disneyland with Sandy. She took to
          me the fancy
          <a
            href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/dining/disney-california-adventure/carthay-circle-restaurant/"
            >Carthay Circle</a
          >
          restaurant in California Adventure. My Dad told a story at the Moth on
          the theme of "cars". Signed back up for WOW Classic with Timmy. Went
          to Benihanna for my cousin Drew's 13th birthday.
        </p>
        <h3>October</h3>
        <p>
          Went to the Disneyland Halloween Party. It was at California Adventure
          this time. My family dressed up as Toy Story characters. I was Woody.
          Secretly got married at the Santa Ana courthouse. Traveled to Mexico
          City a few times in preparation for my wedding.
        </p>
        <h3>November</h3>
        <p>
          Diggy came to visit Los Angeles before going to Mexico City. I got
          married. Partied at Pujol and La Nuclear. Spent some time with my
          whole family in Mexico City. Visited Xochimilco finally. Sandy and I
          hosted a 12 person Thanksgiving dinner in our apartment. We cooked a
          20lbs turkey with the hits and 2 pies.
        </p>
        <h3>December</h3>
        <p>
          Got a 7ft. Christmas tree this year and transported from Home Depot to
          our apartment on top of Sandy's Mini Cooper. Went to the Moth where
          the theme was "Traditions". Celebrated Christmas Eve at my Mom's and
          spend the night in their RV. Christmas at my Nini's house. Saw James
          and Nikki in Irvine along with some of my old Acorns buddies.
        </p>
        <h3>Next Year</h3>
        <p>
          Going to Maui for our belated honeymoon. Hopefully going to buy a
          house.
